                At Searcheer, we understand the challenges that students and
                fresh graduates face when entering the competitive job market.
                Born from the collaborative efforts of talented minds from
                Politeknik Negeri Banyuwangi and Universitas Brawijaya, we're on
                a mission to bridge the gap between academic preparation and
                industry expectations.

              <b className="block mt-4">The Problem We Solve</b>
              <p className="mt-1">
                Did you know that 63% of job seekers in Indonesia struggle with
                high experience requirements, while 58% face barriers due to
                educational prerequisites? Many talented individuals spend
                countless hours applying to positions that donâ€™t align with
                their qualifications, leading to prolonged job searches and
                missed opportunities.
